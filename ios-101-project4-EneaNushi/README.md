## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
My only challenge was that I had a typo on my parameters and I when I was runnin the code I alwas was getting an index out of range fatal error
I spent hours to figure it out. Also decoding on my code seems almos corrects, but on some question I can still see the html code. I tried to use other sourcer but I couldn't figure it out'
